Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) is a cutting-edge treatment used during surgery for advanced ovarian cancer. After removing visible tumors via cytoreductive surgery, heated chemotherapy (typically around 41–43 °C) is circulated directly within the abdominal cavity. This targeted approach allows much higher local drug concentrations while minimizing systemic toxicity. The heat enhances drug uptake by cancer cells, improving effectiveness and destroying microscopic disease 

HIPEC offers several benefits:

Better penetration and efficacy: Heat increases chemotherapy absorption by tumor cells .

Reduced systemic side effects: As chemotherapy stays localized, overall toxicity is lower 

Improved survival: Studies report longer recurrence-free and overall survival when HIPEC is added to surgery versus surgery alone 


However, HIPEC is a complex procedure requiring experienced surgical oncology teams and robust hospital infrastructure. Ideal candidates are selected through multidisciplinary evaluation, based on factors like disease stage, overall health, and ability to tolerate extensive surgery 


For specialized HIPEC treatment in India—particularly in Ahmedabad—Dr. Nitin Singhal, trained at Tata Memorial Hospital, leads in offering this advanced therapy. His extensive experience in ovarian cancer HIPEC underscores his expertise in maximizing treatment efficacy while managing risks
